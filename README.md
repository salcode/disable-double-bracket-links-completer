## Description

This plugin disables the double bracket links completer in the WordPress block editor.

By default, in the WordPress block editor typing `[[` opens an auto-completer for other posts on your WordPress site. This plugin disables that auto-completer so that typing `[[` does not trigger any behavior.

This plugin was inspired by [Disable Autocompleters in the WordPress Block Editor](https://neilsonwebdesign.com/disable-autocompleters-in-the-wordpress-block-editor/) by Ryan Neilson.
